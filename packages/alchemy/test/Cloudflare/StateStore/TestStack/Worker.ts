/**
 * A minimal Cloudflare Worker used by the login integration test.
 *
 * Lives in its own file so `main: import.meta.path` resolves to a
 * module that does **not** execute `Alchemy.Stack(...)` /
 * `Cloudflare.providers()` at load time — those pull in every
 * provider (including `CloudflareAuth` → Clank → `sisteransi`) and
 * end up in the worker bundle. Keeping the worker entry lean avoids
 * "No such module 'sisteransi'" at deploy-time.
